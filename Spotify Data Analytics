# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,

valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,

)

# Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
# Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

# Look at the entire data
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

# Top 5 popular artists and their tracks
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity  
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc LIMIT 5

# The average popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 
SELECT

# The longest song 
SELECT artist_name,track_name, duration_ms 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

# Relationship between danceability and popularity
SELECT artist_name, track_name, danceability, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability desc LIMIT 10

# Artists sorted by average danceability score
SELECT artist_name, avg(danceability)

## Use of CTE

# Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. 
# Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.
